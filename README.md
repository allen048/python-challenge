# python-challenge

I was able to develop two python scripts. One for PyBank which involved analyzing the financial records for my company and one for PyPoll which involved helping a small, rural town modernie its vote-counting process. To create these analyses I used data from two csv files, one called business_data.csv for PyBank and one called election_data.csv for PyPoll. I produced a summary of the data for each analyses via MacOS Terminal and two text output files. Thisn as a large dataset for both scripts, so I used python instead of excel to complete these assignments.
