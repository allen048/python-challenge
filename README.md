# python-challenge

I was able to develop two python scripts. One for PyBank which involved analyzing the financial records for my company and one for PyPoll which involved helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. To create these analyses I used data from two csv files, one called business_data.csv for PyBank and one called election_data.csv for PyPoll. I produced a summary of the data for each analyses via MacOS Terminal and two text output files. This was a large dataset for both scripts, so I used python instead of excel to complete these assignments. Listed below are the instructions for both analyses:


PyBank Instructions:
You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


PyPoll Instructions:
You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
